        " Data Collection: The analyst gathers all the raw data they need from a variety of sources, such as company databases (using SQL), web APIs, and static files like CSVs or Excel sheets.\n",
        "\n",
        " Data cleansing, which is often termed data preparation or wrangling, is usually the stage that takes the most time.  Cleaning up the raw data makes it right and useful.  This entails correcting errors, removing duplication, and making sure that all the formats are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        " Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA): In this step, the analyst employs statistical tools and methodologies to \"explore\" the clean data and find patterns, correlations, and outliers.  This is where the important points are.\n",

        "Prompt Engineering is the careful planning and improvement of the input (the \"prompt\") given to a Generative AI model (such a Large Language Model) so that it gives the most accurate, relevant, and helpful output.  You need to know how to ask the appropriate question in the right way to get the AI to give you the response you want.  There are two types of prompts:  When you use zero-shot prompting, you tell the model to do something without showing it how to do it first.  You rely entirely on the model's enormous prior knowledge.  \"Give me three bullet points that sum up this article.\"  Few-Shot Prompting:  You provide the model a few samples of the work you want it to execute at this point.  This \"primes\" the model so it knows what kind of format or pattern you want it to follow."

The main duty of a Business Analyst is to find ways to fix problems in a company by looking at business processes, stakeholder needs, and coming up with solutions.  Their duty is to link business demands with technical teams, turn corporate goals into functional specifications, and plan out how things will work.  They often ponder about what needs to be constructed or improved in the future.  A Data Analyst, on the other hand, solely cares about the numbers.  Their major duty is to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize massive datasets so they can answer particular queries and locate new information.  They frequently undertake historical or diagnostic work, which means they look at patterns and trends to figure out what happened and why.  A business analyst (BA) finds out what the problem is and how to fix it. A data analyst (DA) looks at data to help with that fix and see how well it works.\n"

        "\n",
        " Before they leave, hospitals can give extra care to patients who are at high risk.  This helps patients get healthy and saves the hospital money by keeping them from having to pay big fines for having a lot of readmissions.\n",
